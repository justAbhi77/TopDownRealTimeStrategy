# Realtime Strategic Game ([CodeLikeMe](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeLikeMe))

This is a simple real-time strategy game. The game features basic mechanics such as unit movement, resource gathering, and building construction. We will be using references from games like Age of Empires or Total war style games that contain combat elements with large groups of units that are composed of a large number of characters.

This is a project that is being developed in a series of videos on the [CodeLikeMe YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeLikeMe) named [Unreal Engine 5 Real Time Strategy Game with C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF0dKxPAYhk&list=PLNTm9yU0zou5_PYxEdjNbAgbVRn-daOga).
